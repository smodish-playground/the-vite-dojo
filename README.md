# Dev Dojo - slightly modified

This is from the final tutorial project from NetNinja's React and Firebase course utilizing:

- React
- Firebase(8.5) Auth & FireStore
- React Router
- React Select
- Date-fns

It is hosted with Firebase Hosting.

Instead of using create-react-app, I started the project [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)
