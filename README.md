# Dev Dojo - slightly modified

This is from the final tutorial project from NetNinja's React and Firebase course utilizing:

- React
- Firebase(8.5) Auth & FireStore
- React Router
- React Select
- Date-fns

It is hosted with Firebase Hosting.

Instead of using create-react-app, I started the project with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/)

This was a big project, covering a lot of things in React including custom hooks, useContext, useReducer, and a little on useRef. It has also given me a good start with Firebase.
